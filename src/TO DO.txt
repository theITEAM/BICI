Do proposals at the end....



- Get Marek's individual sampling working

- Get individual sampler sorted

- For transmission trees the rate must be linearly expressed in terms of populations.

- matrix comp plot


- siumulation slow when doing inference



a×η(t)+β×Σ_l' ((1/(1+pow(ubound(d_l,l'|40)/r|α))) {I,l'})

took around 1 min to do

(0) a = a for reparaemterisation

(1) Loading symbol when paraemter spline being viewed
(2) paraemter loading symbol pausing
(3) When matrix is too big then do not output results (maximum 
e.g. let toobig = false; if(num_element(par) > ELEMENT_MAX) toobig = true;
(4) Get AI working with ||l,l'|| approach



model.init_param_needed = true;


loading dirchlet prior
start_add_initial_population();
import_data_table_command(cname);
 get_prior_from_file(pri)
Copy simulated parameters



TO DO
Sort out prior
sort out map
do compartment maps
menu icon
sum using prime
a greek letter must be selected

DONE
chaging name for species, comp etc...
- ctl c v to copy values and priors
