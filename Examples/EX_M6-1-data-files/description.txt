# Model 6.1: A model of Covid-19

## Objective
- Show a possible model of Covid-19.
- Here additional compartments are used to not only more accurately model the disease, but such that the model aligns with publicly available data.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains seven compartments: susceptible $S$, exposed $E$, infected $I$, recovered $R$, asymptomatic $A$, hospitalised $H$ and dead $D$.
- An external force of infection is controlled by parameter $η$ (in reality this could be a spline estimated from raw case data and flight information).
- The transmission rate $β(t)$ is time varying to capture the influence of lockdown measures and vaccination.
- Parameter $f^A$ determines the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic $A$ individuals (comparted with infected $I$ individuals).

## Population
- This consists of the UK population which is initially susceptible.
