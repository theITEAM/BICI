# Model 2.5: SIRS model with waning immunity

## Objective
- Introduce the concept of waning immunity.
- For many diseases recovery in not permanent. Due to mutations in the pathogen an individual can become reinfected at a later date.
- This waning immunity is incorporated into the standard SIR model by a backward transition from $R$ to $S$.
- Such a model can generate multiple epidemics.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$.
- An external force of infection parameter $η$ provides a small proportion of infections from outside the system.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- A recovery duration $m$ (and coefficient of variation $c$) determines how long, on average, it takes for individuals to recover.
- A waning immunity coefficient $ν$ determines the rate at which individuals become susceptible again.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and two infected.
