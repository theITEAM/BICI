# Example D5: Time variation in individual transition observation probability

## Objective
- An example of when the probability of observing individual transitions changes as a function of time.
- Like D4 but with an IBM and individual-level data.
- The probability of observing transitions is given the functional form $a+b*cos(0.03t)$.
- The values $a=0.5$ and $b=0.3$ were used to simulate the data.
- Parameters $a$ and $b$ can be inferred.

## Data
- Partially observed transitions.
- Periodic compartmental observations every 20 time units.

## Model
- A single inidividual-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
