# Model 5.1: A spatial diffusion model

## Objective
- Introduce a model in which a landscape is divided into a grid of cells.
- Individuals move across this landscape by randomly hopping from one grid cell to a neighbouring grid cell.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'Animal' is created.
- This contains a classification 'Location'.
- 'Location' contains a 20x20 grid of cells represented by compartments.
- A hopping rate $ω$ determines the rate at which individuals move between cells.

## Population
- This consists of 100 individuals initially in cell G10-10.
