# Example D6: Time variation in population observation probability

## Objective
- An example of when the probability of observing individuals changes as a function of time.
- Here population observations only detect a fraction $f$ of the true population.
- This, for example, could represent the number of individuals captured during a series of capture campaigns.
- Because capturing individuals is often seasonally dependent, we apply a trigonometric function $f=a*exp(b*cos(0.06*t)$.

## Data
- Time series population estimates.
- Simulated data used $a=0.1$ and $b=0.3$.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'Animal' is created.
- This contains a classification 'Area' with a single compartment 'P'.
- 'P' represents the animal population.

## Population
- This consists of 1000 individuals.
