# Example D8: Time-varying covariate affecting branching probability (IBM)

## Objective
- This example includes time variation in a covariate that affects branching probability.
- This is implemented using 'branching factors'.

## Data
- Known event times are used to inform inference.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains four compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$, recovered $R$ and dead $D$. Together they are known as the “SIRD model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- The *relative* probability of dying is given by $a×exp(b×cos(0.06×t)$.
- The *relative* probability of recovery is 1.
- Mean $m^R$ and coefficient of variation $c^R$ specify the log-normally distributed period to recovery.
- Mean $m^D$ and coefficient of variation $c^D$ specify the gamma distributed period to death.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and two infected.
