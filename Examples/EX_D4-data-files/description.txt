# Example D4: Time variation in observed population transition probability

## Objective
- In this example there is some time variation in observing population transitions.
- The probability is taken to have the functional form $a+b*cos(0.06*t)$.

## Data
- Partially observed population transition data
- Time series population data.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- This consists of 1000 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
