# Example E4: Correlated individual effect applied to a transition

## Objective
- Example of a random individual effect affecting the susceptibility of individuals.
- Unlike E3, the individual effects between individuals are correlated through an **A** relationship matrix.

## Data
- Infection event times.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- An individual effect [g] allows for susceptibility variation across individuals.
- The strength of this variation is determined through variance $Ω^gg$.

## Population
- This consists of 60 groups each with 10 half-sib individuals.
- 598 initially susceptible individuals and two infected.
