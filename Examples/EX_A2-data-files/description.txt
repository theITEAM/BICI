# Example A2: Uncertain initial conditions (single classification)

## Objective
- Introduce uncertainty in the initial population.
- This considers the case of a model with just a single classification.
- On the 'Simulation→Population' page the initial population is set as a distribution (rather than fixed).

- 100 simulations are performed to see stochastic variation.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- The initial population in the $S$ compartment is sampled uniformly in the range between 900 and 1100.
- The initial population in the $I$ compartment is sampled uniformly in the range between 0 and 50.
