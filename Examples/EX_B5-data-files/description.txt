# Example B5: Combined population-based data sources in a Covid-19 type of model

## Objective
- Show how multiple population-based data can be used to inform a Covid-19 model.
- Using this data it is possible to estimate branching probabilities and the time variation in the transmission rate $β(t)$.
- However, this sort of data will not estimate transition rates once infected, so informative priors have been used for these.

## Data
- Population transition data is available for $E→I$ (cases), $I→H$ (hospitalisations) and $H→D$ (hospital deaths).
- Population data for the combined population in $E$, $I$ and $A$ (survey PCR data).
- Population data for the combined population in $E$, $I$, $A$ and $R$ (seroprevalence data).

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$, exposed $E$, infected $I$, recovered $R$, asymptomatic $A$, hospitalised $H$ and dead $D$.
- An external force of infection is controlled by parameter $η$ (in reality this could be time-varying and estimated from raw case data and flight information).
- The time-varying spline $β(t)$ captures transmission between individuals.

## Population
- This consists of the UK population which is initially susceptible.
