# Example S5: Uncertain initial conditions for IBM using individual state

## Objective
- Introduce uncertainty in the initial population for an individual-based model.
- On the 'Simulation→Initial Conditions' page the individuals added to system have uncertainty regarding their initial state.

- 100 simulations are performed to see stochastic variation.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- The initial population consists of 1000 individuals added at the start time $t=0$.
- The initial compartmental specification for these individuals is given by "S:0.98|I:0.02".
- This means that there is a 98% probability of being in the $S$ compartment and a 2% probability of being in the $I$ compartment
