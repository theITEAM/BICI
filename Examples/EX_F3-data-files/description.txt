# Example F3: Derived quantities

## Objective
- Derived quantities are functionally dependent on model parameters or populations, but are not themselves within the model.
- This example shows different derived expressions:
(1) The basic reproduction number $R_0$ is calculated based on an user defined equation.
(2) The time-varying reproduction number is calculated using the function RN(...), where the infected states are placed within the brackets.
(3) The effective reproduction number is calculated using the function RNE(...).
(4) The generation time is calculated using the function GT(...).
(5) The estimated number of infections $NI$ is found by integrating over the force of infection multiplied by the number of susceptible.
(6) The estimated number of recoveries $NR$ in the first 20 time units is derived.

## Data
- Known event times.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SIR model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- A recovery rate $γ$ determines the rate at which individuals recover.
- $R_0$ is derived by equation $Nβ/γ$, where $N$ is the number of individuals.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
