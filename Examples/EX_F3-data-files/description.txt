# Example F3: Derived quantities

## Objective
- Derived quantities are functionally dependent on model parameters or populations, but are not themselves within the model.
- In this example the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is calculated.

## Data
- Known event times.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SIR model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- A recovery rate $γ$ determines the rate at which individuals recover.
- $R_0$ is derived by equation $Nβ/γ$, where $N$ is the number of individuals.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
