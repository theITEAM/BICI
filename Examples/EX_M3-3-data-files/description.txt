# Model 3.3: Metapopulation model of the UK using a spatial kernel

## Objective
- Introduce spatial kernels.
- A kernel is a specified function that gives the probability the disease is transmitted a certain distance.
- Typically, they have a high value at close distance, but decay away to zero in the large distance limit.
- This example uses a so-called "power-law" spatial kernel.
- The 100 largest cities in the UK are incorporated into the model.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', and 'Location'.
- 'DS' contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$.
- 'Location' contains the 100 geographic points.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals transmit disease within a city.
- The parameter $λ$ determines the rate at which individuals transmit disease between cities.
- $η$ is an external force of infection.
- A recovery rate $γ$ determines how fast individuals recover.
- A matrix $M_l,l'$ gives the transmission between cities. This is reparameterised as a power-law distribution, where $Δ$ gives the range over which transmission occurs and $α$ is the exponent (larger values imply a quicker decay with distance).
- $N_l$ is the population in city $l$.
- $P$ is the UK population.

## Population
- This consists of initially susceptible individuals, with city populations taken from census data.
