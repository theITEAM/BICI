# Example D2: Time variation in transmission rate using trigonometric function

## Objective
- In this example the transmission rate is taken to have a time-varying profile using a cosine curve.

## Data
- Time series population estimates.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- The transmission rate is taken to be $β(1+Δ×cos(α×t))$.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
