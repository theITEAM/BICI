# Example C1: Known transition events

## Objective
- Shows an inference example where all transition events are known.

## Data
- Known infection and recovery times for all individuals in an SIR model.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SIR model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- A recovery rate $γ$ determines the rate at which individuals recover.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
