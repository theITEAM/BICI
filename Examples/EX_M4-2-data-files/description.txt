# Model 4.2: Predator-prey model

## Objective
- Introduce a simple model to demonstrate predator-prey dynamics.
- This uses the well-known Lotka-Volterra equations.
- The birth rate of prey is proportional to their population.
- Prey die at a rate proportional to the number of predators.
- The birth rate of predators is proportional to their population as well as the population of prey (because predators rely on prey for food).
- Predators die at a constant rate.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'Animal' is created.
- This contains a classification 'Population'.
- Population contains two compartments: $Prey$ and $Pred$.
- A birth rate $α$ determines how fast prey are born.
- A mortality rate $β$ determines how fast prey die.
- A birth rate $δ$ determines how fast predators are born.
- A mortality rate $γ$ determines how fast predators die.

## Population
- This initial state starts with 100 predators and 100 prey.
