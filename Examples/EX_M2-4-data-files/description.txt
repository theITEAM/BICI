# Model 2.4: The SIS model

## Objective
- Introduce a model that allows individuals to be infected multiple times.
- This can lead to endemic diseases.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$.
- The backward transition to the $I$ state means that this model is known as the “SIS model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- A recovery rate $γ$ determines the rate at which individual return to being susceptible.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
