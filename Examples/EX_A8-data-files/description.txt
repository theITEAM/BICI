# Example A8: Add / move / remove individuals from IBM

## Objective
- To show how individuals can be added, moved and removed from the system.
- 100 susceptible individuals are added at time $t=0$.
- Here we have an SIR model within two fish tanks: $T1$ and $T2$.
- 10 infected individuals are added to tank $T1$.
- At time $t=100$, 10 specified individuals are moved from to tank $T2$. This then initiates an epidemic in tank $T2$.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', and 'Tank'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- 'Tank' contains two fish tank compartments: $T1$ and $T2$.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
