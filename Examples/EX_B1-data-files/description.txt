# Example B1: Time-series population observations for PBM

## Objective
- Inference is done using time-series population data.

## Data
- On the 'Inference→Data' page, data is added that gives a time-series estimate for the number of individuals in the $I$ compartment.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
