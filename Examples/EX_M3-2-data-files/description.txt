# Model 3.2: Metapopulation model of the world using geographical points

## Objective
- Introduces a spatial epidemiological model that uses geographical points (these have a defined longitude and latitude).
- The 100 largest cities in the world are incorporated into the model.


## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', and 'Location'.
- DS contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals transmit disease within a city.
- Parameter $λ$ controls the spread of disease between cities.
- A recovery rate $γ$ determines the rate at which individuals recover.
- Constant matrix $M_l,l'$ is proportional to the interactions between cities (*e.g.*, this can be obtained from movement data).
- $N_l$ is the population of city $l$.
- $P$ is the global population.

## Population
- This consists of initially susceptible individuals, with city populations taken from census data, with two infected individuals starting in Tokyo.
