# Example B6: Time-series population obesrvations for IBM

## Objective
- Introduce population-based data incorporated into an IBMs.

## Data
- On the 'Inference→Data' page population data is added.
- This gives time-series estimates for the number of individuals in the infected $I$ compartment.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
