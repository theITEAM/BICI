# Model 1.2: Individual-based SI model

## Objective
- Introduce the simplest possible individual-based epidemiological model.
- Under simulation or inference, we see timelines for each of the individuals in the system.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
