# Model 5.1: Simple disease transmission experiment

## Objective
- Introduce the concept of a disease transmission experiment.
- These are used to identify factors which affects how readily disease transmits between individuals.
- This example considers the effect of vaccination on susceptibility to disease.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'Animal' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', and 'Vaccination'.
- 'DS' contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- 'Vaccination' contains two compartments: 'Vacc' and 'Unvac' which represent vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.
- A transmission rate $β_v$ determines the rate at which individuals with vaccination status $v$ become infected.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
