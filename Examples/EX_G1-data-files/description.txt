# Example G1: Matrix of genetic differences

## Objective
- Genetic observations on the pathogen allow for the transmission tree to be estimated.

## Data
- Known event times.
- Genetic observations are taken every 20 time units on all individuals in the system.
- A matrix of genetic differences between the observations is used to inform inference.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
