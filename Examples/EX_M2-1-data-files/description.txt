# Model 2.1: SIRD model with branching

## Objective
- Introduce branching in a population-based model.
- Here infected individuals can either recover or die.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains four compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$, recovered $R$ and dead $D$. Together they are known as the “SIRD model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- A recovery rate $γ$ determines the probability per unit time an infected individual recovers.
- A mortality rate $κ$ determines the probability per unit time an infected individual dies.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and two infected.
