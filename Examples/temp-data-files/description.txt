# Model 5.3: Disease transmission experiment with a quantitative genetic model

## Objective
- Introduce disease transmission experiment for estimating quantitative genetic contributions to susceptibility and infectivity.
- A population of full-sib families is randomly allocated into contact groups.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'Animal' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS' and 'Group'.
- 'DS' contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$.
- 'Group' contains 60 contact groups.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines how fast individuals become infected.
- Individual effects [ga] (for genetic contribution) and [ge] (for environmental contribution) characterise individual variation in susceptibility.
- Individual effects [fa] (for genetic contribution) and [fe] (for environmental contribution) characterise individual variation in infectivity.
- $Ω^fa,fa$ and $Ω^ga,ga$ give genetic variances.
- $ω^fa,ga$ gives genetic correlation between traits.
- $Ω^fe,fe$ and $Ω^ge,ge$ give environmental variances.
- $ω^fe,ge$ gives environmental correlation between traits.

## Population
- Each contact group consists of 10 individuals, two of which have been randomly infected.
- The population is made up of 60 sires who each have 10 progeny. These 600 progeny overall are randomly allocated across the contact groups.
