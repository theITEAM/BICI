# Example A3: Uncertain initial conditions (with focal classification)

## Objective
- Introduce specification of uncertainty in the initial population when there is more than one classification.
- The initial population is given on the 'Simulation→Initial Conditions' page.
- Here disease status is a specified 'focal' classification.
- Distributions for the initial populations in focal compartments are set (in this case chosen to be uniform distributions).
- For the other classification ('Sex') a Dirichlet distribution is used to sample the *fraction* of individuals in each compartment.
- 100 simulations are performed to see stochastic variation.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', and a classification 'Sex'.
- 'DS' contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SIR model”.
- 'Sex' contains the compartments $M$ and $F$ for male and female.
- A transmission rate $β_s$ determines the rate at which individuals with sex $s$ become infected.
- A recovery rate $γ_s$ determines the rate at which individuals recover with sex $s$.
- $N$ is the total number of individuals (this model assumes frequency dependent transmission).

## Population
- This consists of S initially uniformly sampled between 9000 and 11000, I uniformly sampled between 0 and 100 and R uniformly sampled between 0 and 100.
- There is a 30/70 split between males and females, as determined from the Dirichlet distribution.
