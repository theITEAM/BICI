# Model F5: Spline reparameterisation

## Objective
- Provide an example of when splines are reparameterised.
- In the special case in which the spline is square, values can depend on populations at the knot time points.
- This is used here to incorporate the effect of disease transmission through marketplaces in a farm-based model.
- Farms are represented as geographical points (either as compartments with *x* / *y* positions, or using longitudes and latitudes).
- Each farm contains a single "individual" that is used to denote the disease status of that farm.


## Model
- A single individual-based species 'Farm' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', and 'Location'.
- 'DS' contains three compartments: susceptible farm $S$, infected farm $I$ and recovered farm $R$.
- 'Location' contains 200 farm positions.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which susceptible farms become infected due to infection coming from markets.
- Square spline $f_l(t)$ represent the disease risk of acquiring infection from one of the other farms which have been at market. It has knot times at daily intervals.
- A recovery rate $γ$ determines how quickly farms recover.

## Population
- A single individual is added to each farm location. All farms are initially susceptible except for one infected.
