# Example A1: Multiple simulations

## Objective
- On the 'Simulation→Run' page the number of simulations is set to 100 (instead of the usual 1).
- When run, the simulated outputs exhibit a range of system dynamics reflecting the inherent stochasticity within the system.
- Shaded regions in the population plots show the envelope containing 95% of simulations.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
