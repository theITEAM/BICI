# Model 1.5: SIR model with gamma distributed infectious period

## Objective
- Introduce non-Markovian (NM) transitions.
- In individual-based models there is greater flexibility to specify the probability distribution over which transitions occur.
- This example uses a gamma distributed infectious period with a mean and coefficient of variation (which is a dimensionless number that specifies the standard deviation divided by the mean).
- Other possibilities include: Erlang, log-normal, Weibull, and fixed period.
- NM transitions can be used to more realistically model disease progression within an individual.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SIR model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- A recovery duration $m$ determines how long it takes for individuals to recover on average.
- A coefficient of variation parameter $c$ determines the variation about the mean $m$ .

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
