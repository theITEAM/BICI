# Example E1: Individual fixed effect applied to a transition

## Objective
- This example includes an individual fixed effect applied to the infection transition.

## Data
- Infection event times.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- A fixed effect 〈g〉 varies the susceptibilities of individuals based on a covariate.
- A parameter $ν^g$ governs the strength of the fixed effect.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
