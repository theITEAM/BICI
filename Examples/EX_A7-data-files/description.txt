# Example A7: Add / remove indiviuduals from population-based model

## Objective
- Introduce adding and/or removing populations after the initial conditions are set.
- Data source in the 'Simulation→Population' page show how the additions and removals are defined.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', and 'Sex'.
- 'DS' contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SIR model”.
- 'Sex' contains the compartments $M$ and $F$ for male and female.
- A transmission rate $β_s$ determines the rate at which individuals with sex $s$ become infected.
- A recovery rate $γ_s$ determines the rate at which individuals recover with sex $s$.
- $N$ is the total number of individuals (this model assumes frequency dependent transmission).

## Population
- This consists of 10000 initially susceptible individuals and 2 infected.
- There is a 50/50 split between males and females.
