# Model 2.3: SIRD model with branching factors

## Objective
- Introduce branching factors in an individual-based model.
- Here infected individuals can either recover or die.
- Unlike branching probabilities, branching factors specify the *relative* probability of going down a branch (note, their sum does not need to add to one).
- They are implemented by clicking on the $I$ compartment and selecting 'Use branching factors'.
- Branching factors are useful, *e.g.*, for models in which time-varying covariates affect branching probabilities.
- In this example the transition distributions down the branches are different (one being log-normal and the other gamma distributed).

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains four compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$, recovered $R$ and dead $D$. Together they are known as the “SIRD model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- Branching factors $b^D$ and $b^R$ determine the *relative* probability of dying or recovering.
- The probability of dying is $b^D$/($b^D$+$b^R$).
- Mean $m^R$ and coefficient of variation $c^R$ specify the log-normally distributed period to recovery.
- Mean $m^D$ and coefficient of variation $c^D$ specify the gamma distributed period to death.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and two infected.
