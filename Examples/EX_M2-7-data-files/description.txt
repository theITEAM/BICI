# Model 2.7: SIR model with demographic stratification and differential infectivity

## Objective
- Introduce differences in infectivity in a stratified SIR epidemiological model.
- Here the population is divided into males and females.
- A 2×2 transmission matrix is used to describe transmission between these two demographic groups.


## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status' and a classification 'Sex'.
- DS contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SIR model”.
- A transmission rate $β_s,s'$ determines the rate at which individuals with sex $s$ become infected from individuals with sex $s'$.
- A recovery rate $γ_s$ determines the rate at which individuals recover with sex $s$.
- $N$ is the total number of individuals (this model assumes frequency dependent transmission).
- Classification 'Sex' contains the compartments $M$ and $F$ for male and female.

## Population
- This consists of 10000 initially susceptible individuals and 2 infected.
- There is a 50/50 split between males and females.
