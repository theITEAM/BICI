# Model 3.4: Farm-based model

## Objective
- Introduce farm-based models.
- In these models farms are represented as geographical points (either as compartments with *x* / *y* positions, or using longitudes and latitudes).
- Each farm contains a single "individual" that is used to denote the disease status of that farm.
- A spatial kernel allows for spread of the disease between farms.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'Farm' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', and 'Location'.
- 'DS' contains three compartments: susceptible farm $S$, infected farm $I$ and recovered farm $R$.
- 'Location' contains 200 farm positions.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which susceptible farms become infected due to surrounding infected farms.
- A recovery rate $γ$ determines how quickly farms recover.

## Population
- A single individual is added to each farm location. All farms are initially susceptible except for one infected.
