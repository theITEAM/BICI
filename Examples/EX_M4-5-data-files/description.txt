# Model 4.5: Logistic growth model with age dependent mortality

## Objective
- This uses a logistic growth model for a wildlife population.
- Age is stratified into 4 different groups: 0-1, 1-4, 4-10, 10+.
- Mortality is depedent

## Model
- A single population-based species 'Animal' is created.
- This contains classifications 'Alive' and 'Age'.
- 'Alive' contains a compartment $N$, which represents the number of individuals.
- 'Age' contains compartemnts $A0$, $A1$, $A4$, $A10+$.
- A birth rate $α$ determines how fast individuals are born into the first age category.
- A mortality rate $μ_a$ determines how fast individuals die in age category $a$.
- Finite resources limit the size of the population through a carrying capacity $κ$.

## Population
- This initial state starts with just a single individual in $A0$.
