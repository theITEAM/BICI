# Example E6: Fixed effect applied to a branching probability

## Objective
- Individual variation is incorporated into branching through a fixed effect.
- Branching factors are used.

## Data
- Periodic compartmental observations.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains four compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$, recovered $R$ and dead $D$. Together they are known as the “SIRD model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- The *relative* probability of dying is given by b〈g〉.
- The *relative* probability of recovering is given by 1.
- Mean $m^R$ and coefficient of variation $c^R$ specify the log-normally distributed period to recovery.
- Mean $m^D$ and coefficient of variation $c^D$ specify the gamma distributed period to death.
- The strength of the fixed effect is determined through parameter $ν^g$.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals of which two are infected.
