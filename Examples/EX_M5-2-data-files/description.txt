# Model 5.2: Disease transmission experiment looking at infectivity

## Objective
- Introduce disease transmission experiment for quantifying differences in infectivity.
- For this it is necessary to combine information from multiple contact groups.
- In this example we consider the effect of vaccination on susceptibility and infectivity.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'Animal' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', 'Vaccination' and 'Group'.
- 'DS' contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- 'Vaccination' contains two compartments: 'Vac' and 'Unvac', which represent vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.
- 'Group' contains 24 contact groups.
- A transmission rate $β_v$ determines the susceptibility of individuals with vaccination status $v$.
- A factor $f_v$ determines the relative infectiousness of individuals with vaccination status $v$. A factor is, by construction, is designed to have an average of one.

## Population
- Each group consists of 10 individuals, half of which are initially infected.
- The vaccination status of the infected and susceptibility individuals is permuted to create blocks of 4 that are replicated 6 times (to make 24 groups in total).
