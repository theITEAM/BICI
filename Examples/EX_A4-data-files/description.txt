# Example A4: Uncertain initial conditions (without focal classification)

## Objective
- Introduce specification of uncertainty in the initial population when there is more than one classification.
- The initial population is given on the 'Simulation→Population' page.
- In this case a prior is placed on the total population.
- A Dirichlet distribution is placed on all compartmental combinations.
- 100 simulations are performed to see stochastic variation.


## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', and 'Sex'.
- 'DS' contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SIR model”.
- 'Sex' contains the compartments $M$ and $F$ for male and female.
- A transmission rate $β_s$ determines the rate at which individuals with sex $s$ become infected.
- A recovery rate $γ_s$ determines the rate at which individuals recover with sex $s$.
- $N$ is the total number of individuals (this model assumes frequency dependent transmission).

## Population
- The initial population is sampled from a uniform distribution between 9000 and 11000.
- A Dirichlet distribution is used to sample the compartmental composition of the initial state (with most individuals in the $S$ compartment).
