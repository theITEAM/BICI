# Model 1.4: SIR model with Erlang distributed infectious period

## Objective
- Introduce the Erlang distribution.
- In population-based models, transitions are normally required to be exponentially distributed.
- The Erlang distribution is a gamma distribution with a specified integer shape parameter.
- This can be used to more realistically model disease progression within an individual.
- Note, Erlang transitions must be unbranching.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SIR model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- A recovery duration $m$ determines how long it takes for individuals to recover on average.
- The shape parameter is fixed to $k=3$.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
