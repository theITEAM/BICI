# Model 1.6: The SEIR model

## Objective
- Introduce a model with a so-called 'exposed' compartment.
- This new compartment allows for a period of time after an individual becomes infected but before they are infectious.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains four compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$, exposed $E$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SEIR model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- A latent duration $m^L$ (with coefficient of variation $c^L$) determines how long, on average, individuals remain in the exposed state.
-  An infectious duration $m^I$ (with coefficient of variation $c^I$) determines how long, on average, individuals can pass on their infection to others.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and two infected.
