# Example F1: Reparameterisation

## Objective
- Here we introduce a farm-based model with reparameterisation.
- A matrix of interactions $M_l,l'$ represents transmission of infection between farms.
- It is reparameterised as a power-law distribution kernel 1/(1+pow($D_l,l'$/$Δ$|$α$)).
- $D_l,l'$ is a reserved parameter in BICI which gives the distance between locations.
- A maximum interaction distance is set which is used to significantly speed up the algorithm (because distant interactions of negligible effect are removed).

## Data
- Event times known.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'Farm' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', and 'Location'.
- DS contains three compartments: susceptible farm $S$, infected farm $I$ and recovered farm $R$.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which infected farms transmit disease to surrounding farms.
- A recovery rate $γ$ determines how quickly farms recover.

## Population
- A single individual is added to each farm location. All farms are initially susceptible except for one infected.
