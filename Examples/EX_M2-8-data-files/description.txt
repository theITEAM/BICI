# Model 2.8: SIR model with demographic stratification

## Objective
- The same as model 2.6 but uses an individual-based model
- Introduces an example of stratification into the SIR epidemiological model.
- Here the population is divided into males and females.


## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status' and a classification 'Sex'.
- DS contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SIR model”.
- A transmission rate $β_s$ determines the rate at which individuals with sex $s$ become infected.
- A recovery rate $γ_s$ determines the rate at which individuals recover with sex $s$.
- $N$ is the total number of individuals (this model assumes frequency dependent transmission).
- Classification 'Sex' contains the compartments $M$ and $F$ for male and female.

## Population
- This consists of 10000 initially susceptible individuals and 2 infected.
- There is a 50/50 split between males and females.
