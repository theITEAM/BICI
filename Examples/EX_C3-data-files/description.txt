# Example C3: Compartmental observations

## Objective
- Illustrates compartmental observations.

## Data
- The disease status of every individual is measured every 20 time units.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains three compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$ and recovered $R$. Together they are known as the “SIR model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- A recovery rate $γ$ determines the rate at which individuals recover.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
