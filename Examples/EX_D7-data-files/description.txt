# Example D7: Time variation in branching probability (PBM)

## Objective
- This includes time variation in the branching probability.
- A spline $b(t)$ is used to represent the probability of dying.

## Data
- Time series population measurements.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains four compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$, recovered $R$ and dead $D$. Together they are known as the “SIRD model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- Branching probability $b(t)$ determines the probability of dying.
- Parameter $γ$ specifies the recovery/death rate.

## Population
- This consists of 1000 initially susceptible individuals and two infected.
