# Example E7: Individual effect applied to a branching probability

## Objective
- Individual variation is incorporated into branching through an individual effect.
- Branching factors are used.

## Data
- Known event times.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains four compartments: susceptible $S$, infected $I$, recovered $R$ and dead $D$. Together they are known as the “SIRD model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.
- The *relative× probability of dying is given by b[g].
- The *relative× probability of recovering is given by 1.
- Mean $m^R$ and coefficient of variation $c^R$ specify the log-normally distributed period to recovery.
- Mean $m^D$ and coefficient of variation $c^D$ specify the gamma distributed period to death.
- The variance of the individual effect is determined by $Ω^gg$.
- Individual effects are correlated through a relationship matrix **A**.

## Population
- 60 sires each have 10 progeny. These 600 progeny are used in the system (of which 2 are initial infected).
