# Example D3: Time variation in transmission rate using covariate

## Objective
- The transmission rate is taken to have a contribution coming from a time-varying covariate.
- The covariate is exponentiated (to ensure it is positive) and modulates the transmission rate through a strength parameter $Δ$.

## Data
- Time series population data is used to inform inference.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- The transmission rate is given by $β×exp(Δ×f(t))$, where $f(t)$ is a time-varying covariate.

## Population
- This consists of 100 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
