# Model 4.1: Logistic growth population model

## Objective
- Introduce a simple model to represent the dynamics of population in a wildlife setting.
- This uses a logistic growth model.
- Initially the rate at which individuals are born is proportional to the number of individuals currently present.
- Finite resources limit the size of the population through a carrying capacity $κ$.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'Animal' is created.
- This contains a classification 'Alive'.
- Population contains a compartment $N$, which represents the number of individuals.
- A birth rate $α$ determines how fast individuals are born.
- A mortality rate $μ$ determines how fast individuals die.

## Population
- This initial state starts with just a single individual.
