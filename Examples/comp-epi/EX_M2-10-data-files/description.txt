# Model 2.10: A model of Covid-19 with age structure

## Objective
- This adds age stratification into model 6.1.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', and "Age".
- DS contains seven compartments: susceptible $S$, exposed $E$, infected $I$, recovered $R$, asymptomatic $A$, hospitalised $H$ and dead $D$.
- “Age” contains 4 age classifications: 0-19, 20-39, 40-59 and 60+.
- An external force of infection is controlled by parameter $η$ (in reality this could be a spline estimated from raw case data and flight information).
- The transmission rate $β(t)$ is time varying to capture the influence of lockdown measures and vaccination.
- An age mixing $M_a,a'$ captures the relative contact rate between different age groups.

## Population
- This consists of the UK population which is initially susceptible.
