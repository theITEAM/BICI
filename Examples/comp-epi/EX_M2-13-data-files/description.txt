# Model 2.13: Environmental pathogen accumulation model

## Objective
- Rather than modelling direct transmission of disease between individuals, here we assume that pathogen accumulates in the environment.
- A disease transmission experiment with multiple contact groups is assumed.

## Model
- An individual-based species 'Animal' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', 'Vaccination' and 'Group'.
- 'DS' contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- 'Vaccination' contains two compartments: 'Vac' and 'Unvac' which represent vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.
- 'Group' contains 24 contact groups.
- A population-based species 'Pathogen' models the environmental accumulation.
- This contains classifications 'Population', which stores the amount of pathogen, and 'Group', which is cloned from 'Animal'.
- A transmission rate $β_v$ determines the susceptibility of individuals with vaccination status $v$.
- A factor $f_v$ determines the relative infectiousness of individuals with vaccination status $v$.
- $τ$ determines the pathogen shedding rate from infected individuals.
- $λ$ determines the decay of the pathogen in the environment.

## Population
- Each group consists of 10 individuals, half of which are initially infected.
- The vaccination status of the infected and susceptibility individuals is permuted to create blocks of 4 that are replicated 6 times (to make 24 groups in total).
