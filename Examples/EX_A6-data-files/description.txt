# Example A6: Uncertain initial conditions for IBM using a distribution

## Objective
- Introduce uncertainty in the initial population for an individual-based model.
- On the 'Simulation→Initial Conditions' page a population distribution is specified as an initial condition. 
- Compared to example A5, this allows for greater flexibility.
- 100 simulations are performed to see stochastic variation.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- A population distribution fixes a total population of 1000 individuals.
- A Dirichlet distribution sets the susceptible and infected populations.
- $α^S$=10 and $α^I$=0.2 implies that there is a 10/(10+0.2)=98% mean probability of being in the $S$ compartment and a 2% probability of being in the $I$ compartment initially.
- Compared to example A5, the distribution for the number of infected individuals is much broader.
- Increasing $α^S$ and $α^I$ by a factor keeps the percentages the same but reduce the uncertainty in the distributions. 
- The initial population consists of 1000 individuals added at the start time $t=0$.
- They have an unspecified initial state (denoted by '.', which is equivalent to an equal probability of being in either state 'S|I').
- Note, if a population distribution is specified, individual added at the start time must have an unspecified initial state.
