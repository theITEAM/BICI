# Example F2: Parameter distribution

## Objective
- In some instances, it is useful for a parameter to be sampled from a distribution.
- An example is a random effect in a mixed model.
- This is illustrated here with a disease transmission experiment.
- The rate of transmission in different groups is modulated by a group-specific factor $G_g$.
- The elements in parameter vector $G_g$ are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $σ^G$.

## Data
- Known transition times.

## Model
- A single individual-based species 'Animal' is created.
- This contains classifications 'DS', which stands for 'disease status', 'Vaccination' and 'Group'.
- 'DS' contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- 'Vaccination' contains two compartments: 'Vac' and 'Unvac' that represent vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.
- 'Group' contains 24 contact groups.
- A transmission rate $β_v$ determines the susceptibility of individuals with vaccination status $v$ become infected.
- A factor $f_v$ determines the relative infectiousness of individuals with vaccination status $v$

## Population
- Each group consists of 10 individuals, half of which are infected.
- The vaccination status of the infected and susceptibility individuals is permuted to create blocks of 4 which are replicated 6 times (to make 24 groups in total).
