# Example D1: Time variation in transmission rate

## Objective
- Introduce a model with time variation in the transmission.
- The transmission rate $β(t)$ is taken to be a piecewise linear spline with knots taken at 6 time points.

## Data
- Time series estimates of the infected population.

## Model
- A single population-based species 'People' is created.
- This contains a classification 'DS' which stands for 'disease status'.
- DS contains two compartments: susceptible $S$ and infected $I$. Together they are known as the “SI model”.
- A transmission rate $β$ determines the rate at which individuals become infected.

## Population
- This consists of 1000 initially susceptible individuals and one infected.
