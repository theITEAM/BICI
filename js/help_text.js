Examples of typical classifications are disease status, location or sex.\nA classification is given a short but meaningful name (such as “DS” for “disease status”) and an index.

Cartesian coordinates are used to represent the usual block style of compartmental models (<i>e.g.</i> the SIR model).

This allows for individual-level data (as well as population-level data) to be utilised in inference, and enables the greatest flexibility to define transition distributions. Furthermore, the dynamics of individuals can vary (beyond their compartmental classification) thanks to so-called individual or fixed effects. Individual-based models, however, can become computationally slow when they contain many individuals.\n• <b>Population-based</b> – The numbers of individuals in different compartments are tracked as a function of time.

Parameters can depend upon classification indices, <i>e.g.</i> <e>β_a</e> where the index “<i>a</i>” represents locations within the model (primed indices can also be used, see below). Parameters need to be set under model simulation and can be inferred from data.\n• <b>Populations</b> – These are denoted by curly brackets and represent the number of individuals within a sub-population (<i>e.g.</i> <e>{I}</e> may represent the total number of infected individuals or <e>{S,M}</e> may represent the number of susceptible males). Indexes can also be used in populations, <i>e.g.</i> <e>{I,a}</e> could represent the local infected population in location “<i>a</i>” .\n• <b>Time</b> – The quantity “t” is reserved to represent time. This can either be explicitly used within an equation, or to indicate a time-varying parameter (<i>e.g.</i> <e>η(t)</e>) represented by a spline.\n• <b>Operators</b> – Standard operators are used to combine together quantities: “*” for times, “/” for divide, “+” for addition and “-” for subtraction.\n• <b>Sums</b> – These can be used to add up over the compartments within a classification. For this purpose a “primed” index is used. For example the text input “\\sum_a' (M_a,a'*{I,a'})” is interpreted as the mathematical expression “<e>Σ_a'</e> (<e>M_a,a'</e>×<e>{I,a'}</e>)”. Here the matrix <e>M_a,a'</e> mediates interactions between different areas and the primed location index “<i>a</i>'” is summed over. To facilitate computation on spatial models, it is possible to restrict the range of sums. For example, “\\sum^max:50_a' (M_a,a'*{I,a'})” only sums over terms where location “<i>a</i>'” is less than 50km from location “<i>a</i>”. This example assumes geographical coordinates. In Cartesian coordinates “max” restricts the Euclidean distance between compartments.\n• <b>Fixed effects</b> – These are denoted by triangular brackets (<i>e.g.</i> <e>⟨w⟩</e>) and allow for an individual property (<i>e.g.</i> weight) to be related to model transitions (<i>e.g.</i> it could be that lighter individuals become infected more quickly). Fixed effects have a population mean of one and are strictly positive. A parameter (<e>ν^w</e> in this case) controls the strength of the fixed effect, which is either set or inferred.\n• <b>Individual effects</b> – These are denoted by square brackets (<i>e.g.</i> <e>[g]</e>) and allow for another type of individual-based variation. Individual effects are log-normally distributed with a mean of one and a variance matrix that can be set or estimated. Additionally, they can be correlated between individuals (through some loadable <b>A</b> matrix), which allows for quantitative genetics models to be incorporated.\n• <b>Functions</b> – A selection of different functions can be added into equations:\n* <i>exp(x)</i> – The exponential function.\n* <i>log(x)</i> – The logarithm function.\n* <i>sin(x)</i> – The sine function.\n* <i>cos(x)</i> – The cosine function.\n* <i>step(x)</i> – The step function (if <e>x>0</e> returns 1, else 0).\n* <i>pow(x|y)</i> – The power function <e>x^y</e>.\n* <i>max(x|y)</i> – The maximum function (if <e>x>y</e> returns <e>x</e>, else returns <e>y</e>).\n* <i>min(x|y)</i> – The minimum function (if <e>x<y</e> returns <e>x</e>, else returns <e>y</e>).\n* <i>abs(x)</i> – The absolute function (if <e>x>0</e> returns <e>x</e>, else returns <e>-x</e>).\n* <i>sqrt(x)</i> – The square root function.\n* <i>thresh(x|y)</i> – The threshold function (if <e>x<y</e> returns 0, else returns <e>x</e>).\n* <i>ubound(x,y)</i> – An upper bounded function (if <e>x>y</e> returns ∞, else returns <e>x</e>).";
