Parameters can depend upon classification indices, <i>e.g.</i> <e>β_a</e> where the index “<i>a</i>” represents locations within the model (primed indices can also be used, see below). Parameters need to be set under model simulation and can be inferred from data.\n• <b>Populations</b> – These are denoted by curly brackets and represent the number of individuals within a sub-population (<i>e.g.</i> <e>{I}</e> may represent the total number of infected individuals or <e>{S,M}</e> may represent the number of susceptible males). Indexes can also be used in populations, <i>e.g.</i> <e>{I,a}</e> could represent the local infected population in location “<i>a</i>” .\n• <b>Time</b> – The quantity “t” is reserved to represent time. This can either be explicitly used within an equation, or to indicate a time-varying parameter (<i>e.g.</i> <e>η(t)</e>) represented by a spline.\n• <b>Operators</b> – Standard operators are used to combine together quantities: “*” for times, “/” for divide, “+” for addition and “-” for subtraction.\n• <b>Sums</b> – These can be used to add up over the compartments within a classification. For this purpose a “primed” index is used. For example the text input “\\sum_a' (M_a,a'*{I,a'})” is interpreted as the mathematical expression “<e>Σ_a'</e> (<e>M_a,a'</e>×<e>{I,a'}</e>)”. Here the matrix <e>M_a,a'</e> mediates interactions between different areas and the primed location index “<i>a</i>'” is summed over. To facilitate computation on spatial models, it is possible to restrict the range of sums. For example, “\\sum^max:50_a' (M_a,a'*{I,a'})” only sums over terms where location “<i>a</i>'” is less than 50km from location “<i>a</i>”. This example assumes geographical coordinates. In Cartesian coordinates “max” restricts the Euclidean distance between compartments.\n• <b>Time integral</b> – These can be used to integrate an expression over time (for derived quantities only). They have the format “\\int dt (…)”, where the content goes in the round brackets. For example the expression “\\int dt ({I})” is mathematically represented by <e>∫dt {I}</e>. By default, time is integrated over the entire system period, but limits can be placed (<i>e.g.</i> “\\int[10,50] dt ({I})” becomes <e>∫^50_10</e><e>dt {I}</e>. Time integration can be used to estimate the relative contribution to different routes of transmission. For example, if the force of infection is given by <e>β{I}+ϕ</e>, the derived quantity “\\int dt (\\phi) / \\int dt (\\beta{I}+\\phi)” gives the relative contribution of external infections.\n• <b>Fixed effects</b> – These are denoted by triangular brackets (<i>e.g.</i> <e>⟨w⟩</e>) and allow for an individual property (<i>e.g.</i> weight) to be related to model transitions (<i>e.g.</i> it could be that lighter individuals become infected more quickly). Fixed effects have a population mean of one and are strictly positive. A parameter (<e>"+fe_char+"^w</e> in this case) controls the strength of the fixed effect, which is either set or inferred.\n• <b>Individual effects</b> – These are denoted by square brackets (<i>e.g.</i> <e>[g]</e>) and allow for another type of individual-based variation. Individual effects are log-normally distributed with a mean of one and a variance matrix that can be set or estimated. Additionally, they can be correlated between individuals (through some loadable <b>A</b> matrix), which allows for quantitative genetics models to be incorporated.\n• <b>Functions</b> – A selection of different functions can be added into equations:\n* <i>exp(x)</i> – The exponential function.\n* <i>log(x)</i> – The logarithm function.\n* <i>sin(x)</i> – The sine function.\n* <i>cos(x)</i> – The cosine function.\n* <i>step(x)</i> – The step function (if <e>x>0</e> returns 1, else 0).\n* <i>pow(x|y)</i> – The power function <e>x^y</e>.\n* <i>max(x|y)</i> – The maximum function (if <e>x>y</e> returns <e>x</e>, else returns <e>y</e>).\n* <i>min(x|y)</i> – The minimum function (if <e>x<y</e> returns <e>x</e>, else returns <e>y</e>).\n* <i>abs(x)</i> – The absolute function (if <e>x>0</e> returns <e>x</e>, else returns <e>-x</e>).\n* <i>sqrt(x)</i> – The square root function.\n* <i>thresh(x|y)</i> – The threshold function (if <e>x<y</e> returns 0, else returns <e>x</e>).\n* <i>ubound(x,y)</i> – An upper bounded function (if <e>x>y</e> returns ∞, else returns <e>x</e>).";

This introduces an “inverse temperature” parameter $φ$ that determines to what extent the data is incorporated into the analysis. When $φ=0$, MCMC maps out the prior and when $φ=1$, the normal posterior is generated.\nAnnealing works by gradually varying $φ$ from $0$ to $1$ (at which point the posterior is then sampled). Precisely how this is done can be selected from the following options:\n• <b>none</b> – No annealing is performed and $φ=1$ during burn-in.\n• <b>scan</b> – $φ$ is optimally scanned using a specified ‘rate’.
