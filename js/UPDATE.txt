- Implementation of Jeffreys priors in models.
- Changes all the examples to use Jeffreys priors.
- Three new prior types have been added "inverse", "power", "mvn-jeffreys" and "mvn-uniform".
- Appendix F has been added which gives a full description of Jeffreys priors. I've dervied the Jeffreys priors for all the distributions used in BICI. Also I've verified these expressions by comparison with numerical integration. 
- An example F4 had now been added to illustrate "factors". There are parameters which can depend on a classification, but are constrained to have a mean of one.
- Section 2.2.9 has been added to the manual to explain parameter factors.
- Allow for matrix representation in output files. This is somewhat more concise for square matrices and is more logical for covarinace matrices.
- In interface, now scrolls to error in script when found.
- Error now appears when trying and failing to load comp-all.
- Corrected problem with spline when starting time is not zero.
- Updated all the examples in BICI to use Jeffreys priors.
