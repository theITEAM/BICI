- Transfered some of the ideas which helped speed up IBMs to PBMs (specificically parallelisation of calculations and using linearisation to estimate change in markov values)  
- Improved speed of MBPs when equations can be put into the linear form.
- Corrected a mistake for annealing under DA-MCMC
- Section 4.3.3 has been added to the manual and this discusses things which determine running time.

JAMIE
- Correction of problem which gave the error "Markov equation has become negative". 
- Added a line to the top of the BICI script to show which version processed it 

GRANT
- So reparameterisation of splines is now possible, provided the splines are square. This turned out to be rather tricky to implement... Basically there was a nice separation between parameters and the system state. But now the two are potentially related and this meant a lot of structural changes to BICI. So I think this can now be used to implement a cattle trading bTB model.
