Hi Grant,

So I've finally sorted out your issues. There were two problems: (1) you were trying to do something that wasn't possible (although perfectly sensible) and (2) I hadn't added the error checking code to tell the user this wasn't possible. 

Basically there is a distinction between time-varying parameters and time-varying equations. So for example the equation "{I}" represents a time varying equation (it tracks the population in compartment I over time). But a time-varying parameter has to have a time-varying spline defined, and so this has restrictions associated with it.

So to do what you are wanting to do, I've come up with a new way to define parameters through the "define" command. This is available both in the interface and in BICI-script. Basically it allows the user to substitute a parameter with an equation and in doing so the parameter itself is removed from the model.

GRANT
- Correct issue with exporting files
- Introduced 'define' command. This allows for equation expressions to be simplified by spliting them up into managable pieces.


CHRIS
- Tried to add in some error checking for reparameterisation, defining and derived quantities, both in the interfact and core code.
