UPDATE v0.63

JAMIE
- Improved description in manual regarding working with BICI-script rather than interface. Secion 7 has been revised.
- Added new Appendix C which provides illustrative BICI commamnds. I'm hoping this hopes help to give a rough overview of what command do (rather than go into all the depth of Appendix B)
- Error messages regarding how posterior simulation commands work have been revised (e.g. to warn against accidently adding individuals twice).
- Allow for the flexibi

GRANT
- Corrected error stopping matrices from being loaded


CHRIS
- I've changed output files so that they use escaped strings (otherwise \beta etc.. look very odd when opened in Excel)
