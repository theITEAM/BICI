BICI achieves Bayesian inference by means of drawing samples from the posterior distribution using a widely applied technique known as “Markov chain Monte Carlo” (MCMC). Unlike many other statistical techniques (such as maximum likelihood), MCMC does not simply follow a predetermined algorithm and produce a final end r

esult. Instead, it successively generates samples that progressively improve the accuracy with which the posterior is approximated. MCMC is continuously run until sufficient precision. 

Currently working on making farm-based models faster
- At the moment simulation is slow so working on improving that


- Using Mareks disease status
- cutting off first passage
- ppc
- time dependency
- .

(1) // TO DO Need a faster way  -  fast way to reduce multinomial
(2) // TO DO EQN CHECK


- Need to sort out local event changes (to do sections)


- FARM model with known infection times not working correctly
- file saved in temp



- direct message from software
- get all examples done
- finish off MFA
- PAS
- when initial "Cannot change pop fixed." error message








- Get Marek's individual sampling working

- Get individual sampler sorted

- For transmission trees the rate must be linearly expressed in terms of populations.

- matrix comp plot


- siumulation slow when doing inference



a×η(t)+β×Σ_l' ((1/(1+pow(ubound(d_l,l'|40)/r|α))) {I,l'})

took around 1 min to do

(0) a = a for reparaemterisation

(1) Loading symbol when paraemter spline being viewed
(2) paraemter loading symbol pausing
(3) When matrix is too big then do not output results (maximum 
e.g. let toobig = false; if(num_element(par) > ELEMENT_MAX) toobig = true;
(4) Get AI working with ||l,l'|| approach



model.init_param_needed = true;

Copy simulated parameters



TO DO
Sort out prior
sort out map
do compartment maps
menu icon
sum using prime
a greek letter must be selected

DONE
chaging name for species, comp etc...
- ctl c v to copy values and priors
