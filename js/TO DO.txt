- Tried to reduce the memory footprint as much as possible (to help with large spatial models). This has involved a lot of changes, so may have introduced errors... I've done a fair amount of testing to try to mitigate this.

- For proposals on observed individuals (simulation and sampling-based) a new adaptive scheme has been adopted. This preferentially sampled individuals which are successfully changed under the proposal (this avoid lots of wasteful proposals in the spatial farm model when only a few farms are infected)

- Some improvements to the equation editor in the interface (different colours used to represent different elements in the equation, as well as indicating matching brackets).

- Parameter diagnostic information provide in the output file using the command 'inf-param-stats' (this is useful for users which don't use the interface)

- Perform additional checks on bici script (e.g. stopping '^' is individual effect name) and tried to improve error messages.

- Made some improvments in the the speed of initialisation (especially for large spacial model).

- Added in sigmoidal function (this is useful when you want to map from a continuous number to something bounded from zero to one (e.g. for a probability)

- Some improvements to manual: Section 2.1.11 and section 2.1.12 added as well revisions to Section 7. The prior section 4.2 has been revised to emphasise the importance of carefully choosing the prior.

- Changed the syntax used for population with fixed or individual effects. Now a ";" is used, e.g. "{I;<g>}". 

- Tried to improve error messages (I've systematically been through script trying to break them in many different ways).

- One of the difficulties in set up a run is to know what the time step should be. I've now added some diagnostics which outputs a run-time warning if either the time step is too large (discretisation error) or too small (computationally inefficient). This doesn't stop executiong of the code, it's just a useful guide. Section 3.3.1 has been added to the manual

- Corrected slowing of interface when many knots in spline
 
 - Improvements to parameter proposals for parameters in equations which are linearly eqpressible in terms of popuations (speeding up by combining calculation of non-population part) 

- Some yellow colours have been added to the potential compartmental colour pallette.

- Update MCMC diagnostic text information to be more informative

- Improvements to loading symbol in interface (to make it more smooth... this is tricky because difficult to know how long things will take a priori)

TO DO §
X(7) Checks on data tables
X(13) Check error messages when changing BICI file
(4) Look at doing posterior simulation from all examples
(1) Go through all the examples and check they are working... look at diagnostic information

(2) Look at diagnostics for kernels
(5) Update manual

X(3) Get period working - move multiple events 


x(6) Error for poptrans data

X(8) joining proposals
(9) example giving age variation using period

(11) Capture recapture example
X(12) Not alive comp measurement

X(14) add grid view
X(15) empty parameter
(20) Get a version 0.4 on github

Changes made for v0.4:
- New diagnostic information which can be found on the "Diagnostics" menu item when inference is performed: (1) This shows expected number of transition from model vs actual number, (2) Distributions are probed looking at the uniformness of the cumulative probability distributions for evidence of biased transitions (see Max Lau paper), (3) MCMC diagnostic information.
- Updates to the manual to help improve the explanations.
- Incorporation of "period" transitions, which allow for a transition event after a certain time period. E.g. this can be used to implement age progression within individuals.
- THe possiblity for parameter "factors" has been added to the model. This provides a good way for adding in categorical fixed effect into models.
- Several new proposals have to added (moving mutiple linked events, moving all events for the same individual, leave/sink proposals.
- Corrections made to add/rem individual proposals (such that they work when some individuals are observed in the system).
- Significant improvements have been made on error messages in both the visual interface and direct from BICI script. These will help user to understand mistakes in the model
- Added example M4.5 to illustrate "period" transition
- Improvements in how loading is displayed in both interface ("Initialising..", "Running..." messages with percentages) and on the terminal.
- Lots of bug finding. 

There have been some minor changes to the syntax for BICI-script, so you might find that ".bici" files which previous loaded up now give error messages. The current manual contains all the BICI command. If you have difficulities let me know and I can help!



(4) comp data seems to be shifted to the left

BICI achieves Bayesian inference by means of drawing samples from the posterior distribution using a widely applied technique known as “Markov chain Monte Carlo” (MCMC). Unlike many other statistical techniques (such as maximum likelihood), MCMC does not simply follow a predetermined algorithm and produce a final end r

esult. Instead, it successively generates samples that progressively improve the accuracy with which the posterior is approximated. MCMC is continuously run until sufficient precision. 

Currently working on making farm-based models faster
- At the moment simulation is slow so working on improving that


- Using Mareks disease status
- cutting off first passage
- ppc
- time dependency
- .
